Nate Mason,Starburst Aerospace,U.S. Air Force; Booz Allen Hamilton; AWS,"Living authenticity makes me feel alive. It helped me find happiness, freed me to focus on the present, and taught me to be a better leader. I am grateful that I learned to live in my truths, but I can remember a time when it was not so easy.     I grew up in a conservative Christian family. We attended church every Sunday and Wednesday. Faith in a higher being was omnipresent during my adolescent years and influenced the way I valued myself. The lessons I learned continue to influence who I am today, but there came a day when I approached a crossroad between my faith and the person I knew I was.   I am gay.   I grew up believing homosexuality was an unforgivable sin. I felt devalued and shameful. I searched for biblical teachings to affirm my existence but that only weakened my faith. I wondered if God loved me and if my parents would be proud of me if I came out. I lived in a constant state of self-examination that permeated every waking hour.   I joined the Air Force, in part, to escape the world I knew to allow myself to explore my faith. I met people who permitted me to challenge my beliefs. I re-examined the obstacles between faith and identity and found that the two can exist concurrently.    Living authentically enables me to allot all of my energy toward professional and personal goals without the burden pretending to be someone else. More than that, living authentically developed me into a better leader. I know that by allowing those I lead to be their true selves, we all perform at our bests.

"Rahul Nayak, MD MTM",Stanford Health Care,"Berkeley Lights, Theranos, and several stealth mode startup ventures","I am a graduate trained engineer and emergency medicine physician. Undergraduate training in bioengineering with a minor in chemistry from UC Berkeley. I worked on my own building my own company while an undergrad at Cal focused on medical devices. I was part of the Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology at UC Berkeley where I earned a certificate as part of the program curriculum as an undergraduate. While an undergrad, I was heavily involved in bioengineering research and worked for Berkeley Lights, a biotech startup which at the time was a very small group. I later went to graduate school jointly at UC Berkeley and UCSF focused on translational medicine and bioengineering. I worked at Theranos after graduate school. I left for medical school to develop a better clinical understanding and appreciation for the gaps we face in currently healthcare delivery so I could use my engineering skills to address these problems. While in medical school I worked on simulation development in the fields of emergency medicine and obstetrics. Following medical school, I started my residency training as an emergency medicine doctor at Stanford where I am currently a senior emergency medicine resident physician - in this capacity I work in the emergency departments at Stanford, Kaiser, and Santa Clara Valley Medical Center and also teach junior level residents and medical students. Over the last several years, I have worked on several startup ventures focused on  strategies for improving triaging for patients in hospitals. Most recently, I mentored a group of bioengineering undergraduate students at UC Berkeley to develop a noninvasive device for use in resuscitation of patients in cardiac arrest. Over the last year, I also have served as an Industry Advisor, mentor, and judge for the Big Ideas @ Berkeley competition through The Blum Center for Developing Economies at UC Berkeley.

Previously, I was a founding general partner of $350M early-stage VC fund focused on investments in software, semiconductor, IT infrastructure and optical networking. I led $75M investment in 12 companies with successful exits including a multi-billion dollar acquisition, two multi-hundred million acquisitions and two successful IPOs.    I have a unique combination of financial and technology expertise with an MBA degree with honors from Columbia University as well as a Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Maryland with engineering roles at AT&T Bell Labs. I would love the opportunity to become an advisor at Berkeley Skylab to help promising early stage hard-tech startups with their business strategy, go-to-market, fund raising, management team build and to leverage the extensive network I have built in Semiconductor, IP and in Silicon Valley, Europe and Asia over the last 20+ years.
